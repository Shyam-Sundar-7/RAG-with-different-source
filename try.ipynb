This will basically allow us to \\nstart logging the model parameters through the mlflow_log_param  function. In \\nthe following case, we will be logging in MLflow the number of trees ( ntree ) and \\nthe number of features randomly sampled ( mtry ) at each split of the algorithm. The \\ncode is illustrated in the following snippet:\\nwith(mlflow_start_run(), {\\n  \\n  # Set the model parameters\\n  ntree <- 100\\n  mtry <- 3\\n    # Log the model parameters used for this run', metadata={'source': 'Local_data\\\\Natu Lauchande - Machine Learning Engineering with MLflow_ Manage the end-to-end machine learning life cycle with MLflow (2021, Packt Publishing) - libgen.li.pdf', 'page': 229}),\n",

In the next two lines, we instantiate the random forest  algorithm by specifying \\nthe Pima.tr  training dataset and adding the algorithm parameters. We then predict \\nusing the Pima.te  test data. The code is illustrated in the following snippet:\\n  rf <- randomForest(type ~ ., data=Pima.tr, ntree=ntree, \\nmtry=mtry)\\n  \\n  pred <- predict(rf, newdata=Pima.te[,1:7])\\n10. We can now focus on calculating metrics around model performance—in this case, \\nspecificity and sensitivity—through the confusionMatrix  method available in \\nthe caret  package, as follows:\\n# Define metrics to evaluate the model\\n  cm <- confusionMatrix(pred, reference = Pima.te[,8])\\n  sensitivity <- cm[[\"byClass\"]][\"Sensitivity\"]\\n  specificity <- cm[[\"byClass\"]][\"Specificity\"]\\n  \\n  # Log the value of the metrics \\n  mlflow_log_metric(\"sensitivity\", sensitivity)\\n  mlflow_log_metric(\"specificity\", specificity)', metadata={'source': 'Local_data\\\\Natu Lauchande - Machine Learning Engineering with MLflow_ Manage the end-to-end machine learning life cycle with MLflow (2021, Packt Publishing) - libgen.li.pdf', 'page': 230}),\n",

Finally, we can serialize the model function and log it in MLflow so that it can be \\nreusable from another R notebook, by using the crate  method available on the \\ncarrier  package. We end up logging the model with mlflow_log_model   \\nand closing the code with a bracket on the last line, as illustrated in the following \\ncode snippet:\\n  predictor <- crate(function(x) predict(rf,.x))\\n  mlflow_log_model(predictor, \"model\")     \\n})\\n13.

The next category of image is a floating image, one that “floats “ on the page and is surrounded by text. Word supports more types of floating images than are possible with current ebook technology, so the conversion maps floating images to simple left and right floats, as you can see with the left and right arrow images on the sides of this paragraph.\\n\\nThe final type of image is a “block” image, one that becomes a paragraph on its own and has no text on either side.
